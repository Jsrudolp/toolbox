## What is Socratica?

TLDR: We assemble kind, nerdy, and ambitious young people that are dedicated to consistently creating.

We’re united by a couple of core beliefs:

1. There are increasingly few, low stakes ways for young people to make interest, values aligned friends IRL
1. These spaces need to be recurring, consistent, and accessible.
1. Great creative work is done together, across backgrounds and disciplines
1. Small, high trust groups are the foundation of boundary pushing work - in engineering, science, art, and more

Our job is that not of organizers, but **little scheming elves** trying to support the growth of great people over time. In our current form, we’re known for **running co-working sessions for high effort passion projects, gathering makers, builders, artists - and everyone in between.** We meet weekly to make and demo cool projects. Every season, we have a symposium showcasing said projects. It’s a [community of practice](https://www.wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/). It's time carved out for deep work, a space to meet their people, or a playground to talk about ideas.

We’ve incubated hundreds of projects. They include but are not limited to:

- Code - [3D models in Desmos](https://twitter.com/RealSimonWu/status/1716129921930526831), [transit mappers](https://map.henryn.ca/), [Anomia mobile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfKF9IL_5E4), [vertical farms](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2kp5vVKHWdA54R9e6), [WebGL Gaussian Splat Renderers](https://shahan.ca/gs-editor/), serial port readers for SoC
- Companies - Chess tutoring platforms, Shopify upselling, educational robotics kits, [medical referrals](https://relaymd.com/), enterprise LLMs
- Writing - [Blogs](https://boxx.substack.com/), free-form poetry, journalism on food security, [YouTube video scripts](https://www.youtube.com/@adultingexplained?themeRefresh=1)
- Art - [Feature length films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oCIi8tz518&pp=ygUHeWlpbXVrYQ%3D%3D), [Dune oil portraits](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv4yQtNg6nk/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D), [Kubernetes launch logos](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-now-supports-kubernetes-version-1-28/), original albums, hand drawn animations, [fonts](https://twitter.com/lychkel/status/1722289626424168903), fashion designs, [documentary](https://www.unstuck.film/), and [atlas on technological progress](http://leversforprogress.com/).
- Research - Brain image generation, bioplastics, Protein Folding, [Trans Healthcare](https://website-ten-henna-54.vercel.app/), linguistics
- Fun - Minecraft towns, [matchmaking services](http://matchmaking/), setting up a "Dungeon"

That being said, once you gather a group of like-minded people, the sky's the limit! Some nodes have gone on to hold mini-accelerators, grant programs, and residencies.

We started in Waterloo, and have helped spin up 14+ independent nodes. Active nodes are featured on [/map](/map)!

## What We Do It For

Ideally, **who** you do this for is your current or past self. This is a space that **you** would have personally wanted to exist.

TLDR: Modern work (and past work for that matter) is that of optimization, efficiency, delegation, organizational hierarchy, task management.

- If you are in a 9-5 culture, what it means to play/explore outside of work
- If you are in school culture, what it means to not only just care about internships and grades

In these environments, if you want to do creative work that is different, you’ll have to go against the grain. This is typically done alone. Expectedly, this is hard to sustain. Even if the average person isn’t intentionally shutting down your work, we implicitly adopt the values of the people around us. Without the social circle and collaborators that cue that this exploration is encouraged, it may fade.

The myth of the lone genius enforces this pattern, with stories of great scientists and artists that hunker down, sit in rooms surrounded by books, and emerge with grand discoveries. If they could do it, why can’t I? Then the isolation and loneliness doesn’t seem so bad - it’s a part of the process right? Especially if how hard you’re trying is measured by how much [suffering you put yourself through](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bx3gkHJehRCYZAF3r/pain-is-not-the-unit-of-effort).

**But what we talk about less, are the supporting squads that usually make this boundary pushing work possible.** In the words of author Michael P. Farrell, “extraordinary creativity is often the result of successful collaboration among peers who develop an intense friendship and work together on similar projects for an extended period of time”. History makes a compelling case for this. We see echoes of this in the French Impressionists; Sigmund Freud and his friends; C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Mary Shelleyand the Inklings; social reformers Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony; the Fugitive poets; and the writers Joseph Conrad and Ford Maddox Ford. In engineering and the sciences, the Homebrew Computer Club and Vienna Circle.

It’s not just the physical act of working alongside someone (although we do encourage it), but it’s emotional and intellectual companionship. It’s having people around you doing similar things, to discuss, encourage, and critique your approach.

Novel creative work can already be hard. Maybe your circuits aren’t working or your words aren’t flowing. It can be both vulnerable and consuming. **Wanting to break off and explore/make/create in a culture that doesn’t, is inherently isolating - this loneliness shouldn't be the reason great people don't do great things.**

- You have people you can share your wins, work through the losses, and brainstorm with. Even if you’re working on something completely different, there’s someone also exploring alongside you. How they push themselves, encourages you to explore the edges of your creativity. How you push yourself, encourages them to do the same.
- Then, things no longer look so bleak. You no longer have to choose between feeling at ease in your brain, and outside of it.

- Work and belonging fuel each other. When people are having a great time they become creatively inspired. When people can have fun with coworkers in healthy environments it pushes them to take ideas further than they thought possible. Dedicating time to working on things you care about and being vocal about it is maybe THE best bat signal for attracting people you’d probably have fun, brain expanding conversations with, and play helps build trust/help things become part of your identity. This is the feeling we want to facilitate. **The things we do are better done together.**

The cycle doesn’t just feed into itself. When done right, it makes people better, in the ways they want to be :)

We’re in the business of helping people find their people.

## What we believe in

There are a couple core principles that should be across all nodes.

- **We’re not married to the format, we’re married to what works** - The point of running anything is to engineer a _feeling_. It’s the feeling of being excited about what’s possible, and relief that you’ve found kind, curious people to share the potential with. That may or may not be tied to a format, but we're not stuck in formalities. We encourage experimentation week to week.
- **Do work you care about** - Create the things you want to exist in the world, especially if it’s taking a backseat. People are perceptive - if you work on things important to you, it’ll encourage others to do the same!
- **Accommodations are not a burden** - It sucks to feel like an outsider based on needs or circumstances. Going the extra mile to accommodate a small group also often makes things better for everyone, for example, ramped sidewalks and accessible web design.
- **Everyone is a host** - We all share the responsibility of nurturing and looking after the environment where these conversations take place. That being said, don’t be afraid to tap people on their shoulders and get them involved. Most people are just waiting to be invited to the conversation.
- **Effort-gate** - Start with low barriers to entry and reward those that show up consistently. For example, prioritizing recurring attendees for demos or hosting opportunities.
  - **Keep events free** - No one should ever be held back by a price tag. Always be on the lookout for unexpected or hidden financial barriers that can come with events as well, and brainstorm creative ways to mitigate them.
- **Quality over quantity** - Attendee count can be a helpful signal, but it’s not THE ultimate thing to optimize for. Having a tight knit group of 6 heavily invested attendees is better than a ghost-town-like Discord of hundreds.
- **You don’t need permission to get started** - The first time you do things can be scrappy and imperfect, the most important thing is to start! Can’t find a venue? Don’t get caught up in trying to be recognized as an official school club. Maybe host in someone’s apartment. Find an unlocked classroom that’s open over the weekend. The most important thing is gathering great people together, and everything else will follow, we promise.
