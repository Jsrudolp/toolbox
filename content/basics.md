## What is Socratica?
TLDR: We assemble kind, nerdy, and ambitious young people that are dedicated to consistently creating. 

We’re united by a couple of core beliefs:

1. There are increasingly few, low stakes ways for young people to make interest, values aligned friends IRL
1. These spaces need to be recurring, consistent, and accessible.
1. Great creative work is done together, across backgrounds and disciplines
1. Small, high trust groups are the foundation of boundary pushing work - in engineering, science, art, and more 

Our job is that not of organizers, but **little scheming elves** trying to support the growth of great people over time. In our current form, we’re known for **running co-working sessions for high effort passion projects, gathering makers, builders, artists - and everyone in between.** We meet weekly to make and demo cool projects. Every season, we have a symposium showcasing said projects. It’s a [community of practice](https://www.wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/). It's time carved out for deep work, a space to meet their people, or a playground to talk about ideas. 

We’ve incubated hundreds of projects. They include but are not limited to:

* Code - [3D models in Desmos](https://twitter.com/RealSimonWu/status/1716129921930526831), [transit mappers](https://map.henryn.ca/), [Anomia mobile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfKF9IL_5E4), [vertical farms](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2kp5vVKHWdA54R9e6), [WebGL Gaussian Splat Renderers](https://shahan.ca/gs-editor/), serial port readers for SoC
* Companies - Chess tutoring platforms, Shopify upselling, educational robotics kits, [medical referrals](https://relaymd.com/), enterprise LLMs
* Writing - [Blogs](https://boxx.substack.com/), free-form poetry, journalism on food security, [YouTube video scripts](https://www.youtube.com/@adultingexplained?themeRefresh=1)

* Research - Brain image generation, bioplastics, Protein Folding, [Trans Healthcare](https://website-ten-henna-54.vercel.app/), linguistics
* Fun - Minecraft towns, [matchmaking services](http://matchmaking/), setting up a "Dungeon"

That being said, once you gather a group of like-minded people, the sky's the limit! Some nodes have gone on to hold mini-accelerators, grant programs, and residencies.

We started in Waterloo, and have helped spin up 14+ independent nodes. Active nodes are featured on /map!
