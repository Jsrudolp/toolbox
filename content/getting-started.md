## When you know you should start a node

In short, you should considering starting a node if:

1. You want this for yourself
2. You have faith that there are good people around you
3. You are willing to put in the work to cultivate this

Note that none of those bullets include specific personality traits. You don’t have to be the world’s most charming polymath or the resident superconnector. Everyone has something to bring to the table. For example, introverted organizers may have the insight to set up quieter zones or smaller discussion circles. Extroverts can do the service of raising the energy of the whole room. We encourage people to find complementary [co-hosts](#how-to-find-co-hosts-0).

Among our previous hosts, there are a few common “canon events”.

- Hopping between classes and clubs, without finding environments conducive to meaningful connection or intrinsic curiosity
- Being frustrated after attending hackathons or networking events, finding that the short timespan of the event doesn’t give you the time to meet people fully and properly.
- Coming back from a retreat/trip with a motley crew of people that tickle your brain and heart in just the right ways. Thinking to yourself “wow, I would like to be around people like that all the time”

## How to find co-hosts

Having co-hosts is a life hack to make sure the node survives beyond you. Can’t make it one day? Let them step in! Feeling demotivated? Here’s a built-in hype-man! The ideal co-host is someone you’re inspired by - someone you’d be excited to spend time with even if nobody else showed up. If you can’t find this person yet, it might be worth holding the first session yourself and seeing who it attracts. We’ve seen that the sweet spot is between 2-6 hosts. Only two people are _really_ actively hosting at any given session, but it’s great to have people on rotation. This is because it’s hard to organize and enjoy what you’ve organized at the same time.

The organizers are the culture setters. Ideally they are:

- Compassionate - They see value in spending time around people different from themselves and thinks all people have interesting things to share
- People that make things! - To attract the type of people that are also doing cool things, real will recognize real.
- Agentic - They just get things done. However, they should be low ego enough to experiment
- Fun - A little bit silly, a little bit goofy (underrated)
- Diverse! - Not just in demographic, but in interests. Teach us how to draw! Tell us about climbing a mountain! Walk us through your latest read! All that good stuff.

## How to find the people that are trying to find you

TLDR: Go to events and organizations that preach creativity and action, as well as other types of social and outreach related events.

### Seeking people

If you wanted to get involved with \_\_\_\_ scene at your university/city, what events/organization/people would you go to?

Go to places that are trying to stimulate the same creativity you are looking for:

Eg.

- **University/City clubs** where people preach making things (engineering clubs, painting clubs, poetry clubs, coding clubs… etc)
- **Speaker/ social events** where people look for community! Great for finding people interested in meeting other like minded people around a specific theme/goal (guest speaker events, founder socials, tech hubs, other co-working opportunities)
- **Student showcases** or other places where students can show off their work (poetry nights, art showcases, science fairs, hackathons)
- **Blogs/Personal Websites/Social Media/ Youtube** people you know you think are super cool and are actively working on any of their active publishing content.

If they are showing up to these events, chances are they’ll pull up to your group gatherings! BE BOLD. Creative, action oriented people tend to enjoy learning about other projects and seeing what is out in the world. Reach out to the “coding gods” or “Shakespearen poets” in your life, there is no project too big, or too small to be worked on at Socratica! They might show up… or maybe not, but making that initial contact will help you curate your list of cool people you can nudge later, and introduce the idea of your club into their minds.

### Bringing them back

After that initial contact, the rest of the work goes into the session and branding itself. One core value we believe at Socratica is, **co-working is never that deep.** We like to keep our branding and messaging as fun and light hearted as possible – presenting it as a hangout among friends more than anything else. Ensuring this vibe is communicated upon first contact with anyone you want to join the session, and at the sessions themselves is ESSENTIAL!! Keep in mind that the types of people we bring in will continue to shape the quality of the sessions as well!

- Look for creative people!! the ones working on a movie, blogging their hearts away, hacking on interesting problems. Tap them on the shoulder and invite them to Socratica :)
  - Make sure they have a good time so they’ll invite their friends to Socratica.
- Seeking - Looking for people with high density of action, who’s work you admire/respect through personal websites/social medias/blogs, “depth first search”
- Attracting
  - Branding - Who we market to is who we become.
  - Using silly language.
- Maintaining identity - Being ok with having small groups of people at the beginning

## How to structure a session

Now that you have your host team and a list of aspiring Socraties, it’s time to start planning the session!

Your goal will be to achieve 2 main things: give people time to work on their projects, and showcase + celebrate progress of any sort in your community.

To start, there are typically building blocks to a Socratica session: introductions, pomodoro work sessions, and demos.

### Introduction to Socratica sessions

- **Objective**: Aim to provide time for project work and celebrate community progress
- **Duration**: Typically, sessions last 3-4 hours, segmented into different activities
- **Key elements**:
  - Introductions: Start with 15 mins of buffer time for informal interactions, food and small talk, followed by a group address explaining what Socratica is.
  - Pomodoro Work Sessions: Structured periods for focused work.
  - Demos: Short presentations/updates showcasing participation progress.

### Roles and Responsibilities

- **Hosts**: Rotate through various sub-roles:
  - Main Host - Introduces the session, leads demos, announces breaks
  - Demo Curator - Responsible for ensuring a diverse lineup of demos, choosing a demo order, making sure people are prepared before they demo
  - Tech Lead - Set up projector, timer & music. Help transition demos smoothly.
  - Archivists - Taking notes, snapping photos, sharing publicly
  - Providers - This includes buying food, bringing equipment/resources
  - Greeters - This involves hosts talking to people, inspiring them, matchmaking them with others, and encouraging them to demo!
  - Curating the vibes – see [[cultivating-people#How to organize spaces that feel awesome]] and [[cultivating-people#How to maintain the vibe]]
- **Participants** - The people who show up to your sessions and define the feel of the community.

### Session Setup

- Hosts should set up food, projectors/display and any other equipment.
- Separate spaces for silent work and group-focused activities with a clear physical distinction to minimize distractions.
- Get attendees to help you with setting up food, cleaning up, and other small tasks to give them a glimpse into the “behind the scenes”. It really makes people feel like a part of something.

### Introductions and Icebreakers

- **Mingling:**
  - Encourage people to mingle in groups with unfamiliar people! Accomplish this by yelling or cowbell announcements.
- **Icebreaker Circles:**
  - Run smaller intro circles to identify potential hosts. It also helps boost confidence for people that dont think they’re qualified.
  - People feel SO gassed up when you ask them to run these circles. The more involved people are, the more invested they become.
  - The introduction questions can range from silly to serious. The best ones make people think and give people conversation jumping-off points. Stray from things talking about what they’ve been up to recently, or more surface topics. Hits from our term include:
    - What is one way you’ve changed your mind recently?
    - What do you wish more people knew about you?
    - What is your greatest delusion? What do you believe about the world that seems irrational to everyone else?
    - Do you have any secret talents?
    - What could you give a 15 minute impromptu presentation on?
    - What’s a hobby you’ve been meaning to take up but haven’t yet?
    - What have you spent over 100 hours doing?

### Work Sessions

- **Work Blocks (50 mins)**:
  - When it’s time to start, announce it and usher people who still want to talk into the group work area.
  - Emphasize that the work block is for deep and quiet work.
  - Have a timer up in a way that is visible to everyone. Ideally try to have access to a projector, TV or a spare device that can have the timer presented throughout the session.
- **Break (10 mins):**
  - The perfect time to follow up on projects you find interesting!
  - Start looking out for potential demoers for the session and tapping them on their shoulders!
- **Work Block 2 (50 mins):**
  - After breaks, people may continue socializing. Feel free to nudge them into group talking work areas to ensure they are not disturbing others who are starting to pick up work again.
  - And continue to tap people on the shoulder for demoing!

### Demos

- Ideally, keep each demo around 5 minutes with around 4-5 demos. Allow for questions after the demo!
- Encourage a wide range of demoer’s, across the domain of the project, the stage of the project and the type of speaker.
- And take photos! Document everything!
- Read more under [[#How to hold great demos]]

**The TLDR:** We usually do (10-1PM) but this is flexible! We also run a (2-5PM) session too.

## How to hold great demos

In a company, there are three actions that matter in setting culture: who you hire, fire, and promote. Within a community, the “promotion” becomes who you give the most visibility to. In this case, it’s who you choose to demo and host.

To find great demo-ers, backchannel with other hosts, tap on people who have been showing up consistently, encourage folks working on projects you find interesting, chances are, other people will find it interesting too (see: [[#How to find the people that are trying to find you]]). Actively encourage people to demo at all points in their creation process because every project starts somewhere. Frame demos as an opportunity to share and celebrate progress rather than show off polished work (that is what [[superboosting-ideas#How to organize a symposium]] is for).

The following are some learnings from a few years of facilitating demos:

- **Visuals**: Ideally, having accompanying visuals is fantastic! Visuals are more engaging and get people excited about the project. It also helps to get people excited…. To complete. This doesn’t have to be a screen-shared website. It can be a physical painting, hardware project, or even the demoer themselves doing something live (i.e. guitarist)
- **Storytelling**: Encourage demo-ers to tell a story! Especially if it’s the first time someone is demoing, encourage them to start by sharing why they are working on their project.
- **Keep an eye on the time**: Time boxing is essential as audiences can become disengaged if demos go on for too long. Display a visible timer for the presenter, complete with a noticeable ringtone to signal the end of their allocated time.
- **Encourage people to ask questions:** Allocate time for questions; they often reveal valuable insights that could be the highlight of the session! To make sure that there is a variety of people asking questions across demos, as a host, tap on some folks and encourage them to ask questions. To build a strong culture, you have to actively create it. \
  Some ways we’ve done this that have been successful are:
  _ encouraging specific people who are eager to ask and haven’t gotten a chance yet to demoers. Encourage the demo-ers to act like hosts and call on those people.
  _ If there aren’t enough questions, ask one yourself.
- **Diversity of demos**: When choosing presenters try to be diverse on these axises:

  - Topic (Code, art, writing)
  - Project Stage (Ideating, in progress, complete)
  - Speaker (Shyer people, confident returner, etc)

  To keep folks engaged, order demos in such a way that it feels more diverse. You can do this by spacing out similar demo topics and starting with more creative and unpolished/work in progress demo’s so people who are unsure about demo-ing feel confident to demo their work in progress projects.

- **Encourage and empower:** Some people take 3-4 nudges of encouragement to think that they are qualified to demo. It’s our job to make people think they can and be constructive when they do. Your job as a host is to empower people to gain confidence in demoing and feel comfortable demoing unfinished work in this space. A good way to frame this for attendees is to frame demo-ing as an act of service to the community instead of a place to prove themselves worthy.
  - Hosts can work together with hesitant participants to provide demoing formats that make them more comfortable and confident. You can innovate along the lines of:
    - Time length – experiment with different lengths of demos. 3 minutes can feel intimidating, maybe start with a 30 second demo
    - Demo location – standing in the front of the room can be scary, experiment with demo formats where demos can be shared from their seats or in a circle setting.
    - Audience size – if the sessions are large, you could experiment with having smaller demo groups
    - 1:1 encouragement – ask them about their project 1:1 during break sessions, show authentic curiosity, tell them “that would make a great demo”
- **Managing dynamics:** The only time we’ve really ever really had tense conflict was during the question section of a demo. Be deliberate and step in if things are getting weird. If you think the vibes are off, the audience probably thinks so too. A gentle way to redirect a Q&A is to mention that time is up (if the conversation has been going for a while) or ask to move on to the next question and suggest folks discuss further after demos.
- **Body language:** Remind people to close or lower their laptop screens, encourage folks to take off their headphones and to give the presenters their full attention. Encourage people to stand up and gather near the demoer when people are sitting down at their desks it’s easy for them to get distracted during peoples demos

**Common failure modes are:** As a host, you should look out for these and do not hesitate to intervene early.

- Presenter ignores timer and goes on for way too long
  - Open your phone and set a timer to go off at maximum volume. When the timer goes off, jump in with “Thank you for demoing” and start clapping.
- Presenter speaks very technically
  - Remind them that their audience includes people who are non-technical. Post in an open forum afterwards so that they provide detail to those interested.
- Presenter speaks very early stage, doesn’t have clearly defined project yet
  - Ask probing questions: “What did you specifically work on today?”
- Too many people want to demo and there is not enough time for everyone
  - Reassure people who don’t get a chance that they can demo next week.
  - Create spaces for anyone to share projects at any time, such as a discord channel for projects, or Instagram account highlighting projects.
  - This is also a good time to reward folks that attend consistently – effort gate!

## How to Brand

Your brand identity is extremely important, and extends far beyond the surface of fonts and colours. It’s how you present yourself as an organization– the way that you write, your uniquely obscene usage of emojis, and the vibes you curate at events.

_Our pillars for brand identity:_

- **Be exploratory**: keep things open to interpretation by your team.
- **Be recognizable:** as an influx of bland and unspeaking brand identities pour into clubs, choose assets and create designs that reflect your club, truly
  - Don’t be template-y or overly corporate (unless that is your vibe)- make things that make people want to sign up!
- **Be authentic ;)** no matter what design style you lean into, make sure it is accurate to your organization and its principles (ie. silly, fun, ambitious, playful )

Establish your systems early, but acknowledge that they will evolve. As your org changes, your public facing image will likely change too. Despite having a design system with recommended type treatments and layouts, the Waterloo team treats our 10 page Figma file as a guide.

We embrace the styles of our individual designers whilst setting the bar approachably low. The best brand identities create emotional associations with your work– so strive to create reputable designs with re-usable and iconic elements. When people see a post, they should instantly recognize that it is us.

**What branding includes:**

- Brand Personality
  - Your Name
  - Logos
  - Colour Pallette
  - Typography
  - Visual Elements like Illustrations
  - Photography/Videography Style
- Voice and Tone
  - Ie. Mission Statement, Tagline, and Brand Values
- Overall User Experience
  - How does your website reflect this?
  - What stories, emails, Lumas, and posts create and expand your digital presence?

TL;DR this is important stuff. Never forget to put fun and welcoming first. It doesn’t have to be ‘beautiful’ or ‘perfect’ for you to post it!
