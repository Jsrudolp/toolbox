{"basics":{"title":"The Basics","links":["map"],"tags":[],"content":"What is this? §\nA guide.\nWhat is Socratica? §\nTLDR: We assemble kind, nerdy, and ambitious young people that are dedicated to consistently creating.\nWe’re united by a couple of core beliefs:\n\nThere are increasingly few, low stakes ways for young people to make interest, values aligned friends IRL\na. These spaces need to be recurring, consistent, and accessible.\nGreat creative work is done together, across backgrounds and disciplines\na. Small, high trust groups are the foundation of boundary pushing work - in engineering, science, art, and more\n\nOur job is that not of organizers, but little scheming elves trying to support the growth of great people over time. In our current form, we’re known for running co-working sessions for high effort passion projects, gathering makers, builders, artists - and everyone in between. We meet weekly to make and demo cool projects. Every season, we have a symposium showcasing said projects. It’s a community of practice. It’s time carved out for deep work, a space to meet their people, or a playground to talk about ideas. It’s a community of practice. It’s time carved out for deep work, a space to meet their people, or a playground to talk about ideas.\nWe’ve incubated hundreds of projects. They include but are not limited to:\n\nCode - 3D models in Desmos, transit mappers, Anomia mobile, vertical farms, WebGL Gaussian Splat Renderers, serial port readers for SoC\nCompanies - Chess tutoring platforms, Shopify upselling, educational robotics kits, medical referrals, enterprise LLMs\nWriting - Blogs, free-form poetry, journalism on food security, YouTube video scripts\nArt - Feature length films, Dune oil portraits, Kubernetes launch logos, original albums, hand drawn animations, fonts, fashion designs, documentary, and atlas on technological progress.\nResearch - Brain image generation, bioplastics, Protein Folding, Trans Healthcare, linguistics\nFun - Minecraft towns, matchmaking services, setting up a “Dungeon”\n\nThat being said, once you gather a group of like-minded people, the sky’s the limit! Some nodes have gone on to hold mini-accelerators, grant programs, and residencies.\nWe started in Waterloo, and have helped spin up 14+ independent nodes. Active nodes are featured on map!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Do It For §\nIdeally, who you do this for is your current or past self. This is a space that you would have personally wanted to exist.\nConsistent, creative work can be isolating\nThis might sound familiar. You go to a school where most conversations are subtle competitions around grades or internships. Or you come home from a long day of work, only to relax by watching a treadmill of information that never gets less urgent. Although these are totally fine to do, they often become things that people don’t actively choose for themselves. Personal intention feels like it is in increasingly short supply.\nBut a small (or big) rebellious spark nudges you. You tinker, trial hobbies, or even set off on side quests. You brush by a few people along the way, but you’re mostly doing it alone. Wanting to break off and explore/make/create in a culture that doesn’t, is inherently isolating - this loneliness shouldn’t be the reason great people don’t do great things.\n\nThe myth of the lone genius enforces this isolation, with stories of great scientists and artists that hunker down, sit in rooms surrounded by books, and emerge with grand discoveries. If they could do it, why can’t I? Then the isolation and loneliness doesn’t seem so bad - it’s a part of the process right? Especially if how hard you’re trying is measured by how much suffering you put yourself through.\nBut what we talk about less, are the supporting squads that usually make this boundary pushing work possible.\nCarefully curated environments can make our work and relationships better\nIn the words of author Michael P. Farrell, “extraordinary creativity is often the result of successful collaboration among peers who develop an intense friendship and work together on similar projects for an extended period of time”. History makes a compelling case for this. We see echoes of this in the French Impressionists; Sigmund Freud and his friends; C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Mary Shelleyand the Inklings; social reformers Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony; the Fugitive poets; and the writers Joseph Conrad and Ford Maddox Ford. In engineering and the sciences, the Homebrew Computer Club and Vienna Circle.\nIt’s not just the physical act of working alongside someone (although we do encourage it), but it’s emotional and intellectual companionship. It’s having people around you doing similar things, to discuss, encourage, and critique your approach.[^1]\n**Then, things start to get really exciting. **You have people to share wins, work through losses, and brainstorm with. Even if you’re working on something completely different, there’s someone also exploring alongside you. How they push themselves, nudges you to be better. How you push yourself, encourages them to do the same.\n\nDedicating time and being vocal about what you care about becomes a bat signal, attracting the best conversations of your life and some really great friends. It feels like you’re growing into yourself, rendering your self-image in high resolution. This is the feeling we want to facilitate.\nThe cycle doesn’t just feed into itself. When done right, it makes people better, in the ways they want to be. :)\n\nWhat we believe in §\nThere are a couple of phrases we’re guilty of repeating (and repeating). It helps communicate what we value in a succinct way.\n\n“We’re not married to the format, we’re married to what works” - The point of running anything is to engineer a feeling. It’s the feeling of being excited about what’s possible, and relief that you’ve found kind, curious people to share the potential with. That may or may not be tied to a format, but we’re not stuck in formalities. We encourage experimentation week to week. If coworking doesn’t work, try a different format!\n**“Do work you care about” **- Create the things you want to exist in the world, especially if it’s taking a backseat. People are perceptive - if you work on things important to you, it’ll encourage others to do the same!\n“Accommodations are not a burden” - It sucks to feel like an outsider based on needs or circumstances. Going the extra mile to accommodate a small group also often makes things better for everyone. For example, ramped sidewalks and accessible web design.\n\nKeep events free - No one should ever be held back by a price tag. Always be on the lookout for unexpected or hidden financial barriers that can come with events as well, and brainstorm creative ways to mitigate them.\n\n\n“Adopt the host mindset. Everyone is a host” - Environments get better when everyone feels responsible for making things enjoyable. Some people even feel more comfortable when they feel like they have a little role. Give everyone a chance to be responsible!\n“Effort-gate.” - Start with low barriers to entry and reward those that show up consistently. For example, prioritizing recurring attendees for demos or hosting opportunities.\n“You have permission to get started. We permission you” - The first time you do things can be scrappy and imperfect, the most important thing is to start! Can’t register for a venue? Do it in a public place. Find an unlocked classroom, building lobby, or park. The most important thing is gathering great people together, and everything else will follow, we promise.\n"},"cultivating-people":{"title":"Cultivating People","links":["getting-started"],"tags":[],"content":"How to organize spaces that feel awesome §\nPicture yourself entering a Socratica session. What do you feel? What do you want the participants to feel? How do hosts ensure that Socratica remains inclusive, beginner-friendly, and a good time?\n\nBalance is key – people want to be in spaces where they feel like they can bring their full self. This means seeing people that they can relate to. However, this has to be balanced with making sure we aren’t including people tokenistically.\nNon-tokenistic inclusion – while we want to have people from all races, gender identities, and majors represented, Socratica aims to be inclusive beyond mere representation and cosmetic gestures. Inclusion is not just about avoiding discrimination or having people of different backgrounds to check off some boxes; it’s about actively promoting and celebrating the differences that make us stronger and more innovative as a collective whole. See How to hold great demos on how to make diversity show up in different ways.\nAccessibility – We want Socratica to be accessible – financially, mentally, physically, socially. Organizers should take note of mobility concerns, dietary preferences, or any specific needs and take efforts to accommodate them without imposing. They should also think about the schedules and habits of their target audience. Are they students? Hosting near or on a campus makes it easier for students to access the event. Are they working adults? Hosting on weekends and after work hours in places easily accessible by public transport make it easier for folks to get to the venue.\nPhysical space – Think about how the tables and chairs are placed for intros and demos. You want to create a space where people can naturally gather to chat and move freely amongst the crowd to talk to lots of people. Look out for furniture placement that makes it hard for large circles to form. Where is the snack table placed? Is it in an area where people can stand nearby to chit chat during breaks? Think about the sound levels in the space. If you have access to a speaker, play some lofi music throughout the sessions.\nLightning: this is very venue dependent. If your Socratica sessions are hosted during the day, ideally find spaces that let in natural light. If the sessions are happening at night, try to find spaces that feel cozy and don’t have harsh fluorescent lighting. While we want folks to get great work done, we also want people to feel good in the space they are in.\nDirectly reach out to great people: Tap people on the shoulder to come. Don’t just send them an invite link or blast it on your socials, but personally ask them to come. This helps both the hosts and community members feel like they have a stake in helping set the culture/vibes\n\n“An important aspect of design is the degree to which the object involves you in its own completion. Some work invites you into itself by not offering a finished glossy, one-reading-only surface. This is what makes old buildings interesting to me. I think that humans have a taste for things that not only show that they have been through a process of evolution, but which also show they are still a part of one.”\n\n\nUse structure as guidance: sessions have a defined structure to guide the overall schedule, however we don’t want to be too rigid with this. We encourage folks to work on passion projects and work that isn’t related to their employment or school. We hope participants are excited about finding passion projects to work on that fit into that structure, but sometimes people will work on things related to work or school – and that’s ok. We are striving to create an environment that makes space for passion projects but we don’t want to dictate what people can work on.\nLanguage: The language you use to describe the sessions and host are part of the overall brand (see: How to Brand). The language should match the vibe of the event (or the aspirational vibe). For most Socratica events, they are meant to be inclusive, beginner friendly and a fun time – so the language should reflect that. Imagine you were being invited to a fun event, how would you want it to sound? Since Socratica isn’t a high commitment, high barrier to entry activity, aim to use language that sounds more like you’re inviting a friend rather than hosting some exclusive\nIntroduce people, be a host! Especially when your community is newer, as a host, you will need to be extra involved with helping people get to know each other. Read through the lu.ma (or whatever application/RSVP capturing method you use) and take note of what folks interests are. Introduce people with similar interests! The most important part of a strong community are the people and how connected they feel to each other. Help fast track that by actively introducing folks you think would get along together.\n\nHow to make newcomers feel welcome §\n\nIf you don’t recognize someone, a good rule of thumb is to assume it’s their first session – ask if it’s their first session, explain what this space is, who it is for, how it is set up etc.\n\nExplain what these sessions are to clear expectations from the start.\nThis is an uncommon structure of event, it’s high interdisciplinary do-what-you-care-about-ism, so people come to it with many confusions &amp; assumptions based on who / what they’ve seen about it elsewhere.\n\n\nShowing each new attendee they belong here just as much as you do.\n\nThere is an art to doing this without creating a power dynamic (i.e. avoid making the newcomer feel like you are above them because you are “in charge”). Be a genuine friend.\nAsking\n\n\nYou want everyone to feel welcome, not tokenized\n\nThe nature of tech bro culture, can often people from underrepresented groups” feel welcome enough to show up, demo. Sometimes hosts feel inclined to focus energy on them to really try to get them to come back for future sessions (i.e. push them to demo). This is good (because diversity is good), but we don’t want people to feel tokenized, or that they’re desired here because of these “statuses”.\n\n\nMake sure they have a great conversation with at least one person\n\nIntroduce them to other people! It makes a big difference in their experience having met other welcoming people beyond the hosts.\nLoop them into conversation groups and have newcomer introduce themselves! -Bruce\n\n\nGive them responsibility. It’s nice to have a reason to be somewhere\nIt feels special to come to the sessions for a second time and people remember your name, it adds significantly to that feeling of being part of something.\n\nHow to help people level up §\nFrom the outside, it might seem weird that people are willing to give their time to organize. The truth is, organizers actually stand to benefit the most from the sessions.\nBut, how do we sustainably cultivate a group of organizers that consistently show up to contribute to a version of the world they believe should exist? At the end of the day, you don’t want the people that really want to be in control, to be in control. The goal is to help good people become powerful, and powerful people become good.\nThis means that there is work to be done to ensure the longevity of the node. You’re now in the business of leveling up people — aka, help them realize they had leadership potential in them the entire time.\n\nYou want the people who are excited to be there + make others feel welcome (already doing the host-like things without being one yet!)\nTapping people on the shoulder, and opening them up to a space they can take initiative in. From organizing warm up circles, to hosting a session, to hosting a term.\n\nNeed last minute helpers for an event? Text them. Want someone to let people in at the door? Ask them.\n\n\nGassing people up when they help out – e.g. express public appreciation like “person X helped us bring up pizza without asking”. Saying good things behind their back gives other people a green light to ask them for help, and makes person X feel even more involved.\nAsk them their thoughts on a new idea you’re trying out! Organizers are in the same shoes as attendees at the end of the day. Show them their presence matters. Help them build confidence/trust within themselves - eventually, they’ll be ready to approach others with the same curiosity and care.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n\nThe VP-ification of hosting. This is especially applicable in a university setting. People may flock to the prospects of having an “exec position” or label to put on their resume. Avoid this by never establishing titles.\nNot having a balanced host team. Our leadership should reflect the diversity of our attendees – this applies to interests, profession, age, ethnicity, gender, etc.\nHaving the same hosts lead for too long. They should transition to mentorship positions after ~4 months, max one year – everyone should be doing work that feels fun / exciting / challenging to them.\n\nYou can’t level up if you’re stuck in the same place and you’re keeping other people from growing in the ways you have benefitted from hosting – don’t stunt growth.\n\n\n\nHow to maintain the vibe §\nkai ideas:\n\n\nif people feel welcomed, they will keep coming\n\n\nbe transparent about what our intentions are, and what we’re trying to do to achieve them\n\n\nsocially encourage the right kind of behaviour\n\n\nshow other people how to be kind\n\n\nrequest for people to help contribute, and guide them on how\n\n\nmake it obvious what the right thing to do is\n\n\nmake it easy to do the right thing; if too many people are talking instead of working, turn up the music a little bit so that it’s more annoying to talk.\n\n\nThere are some theories about community building, one of them being evaporation cooling, the idea that the quality of a community is destined to deteriorate over time. It doesn’t have to be like this.\nSugar cabinets - It’s a great idea to keep an ongoing document of nice texts, enthusiastic feedback, and cool projects to remind yourself of why you started holding these spaces anyways.\nMake this open source! Share the impact with your co-hosts.\nHealthy turnover - The activity span of a host can be prolonged with great treatment and enthusiastic feedback, but sometimes There’s usually tension between being an attentive organizer and getting deep work done. For some of our hosts, they might want to return to work mode.\nFun fund -\nEffortgating - The idea that people should not be promoted/rewarded by gatekeepers and an application process, but how much effort they are willing to put in\nManaging growth -"},"getting-started":{"title":"Getting Started","links":["cultivating-people","superboosting-ideas"],"tags":[],"content":"When you know you should start a node §\nIn short, you should considering starting a node if:\n\nYou want this for yourself\nYou have faith that there are good people around you\nYou are willing to put in the work to cultivate this\n\nNote that none of those bullets include specific personality traits. You don’t have to be the world’s most charming polymath or the resident superconnector. Everyone has something to bring to the table. For example, introverted organizers may have the insight to set up quieter zones or smaller discussion circles. Extroverts can do the service of raising the energy of the whole room. We encourage people to find complementary co-hosts.\nAmong our previous hosts, there are a few common “canon events”.\n\nHopping between classes and clubs, without finding environments conducive to meaningful connection or intrinsic curiosity\nBeing frustrated after attending hackathons or networking events, finding that the short timespan of the event doesn’t give you the time to meet people fully and properly.\nComing back from a retreat/trip with a motley crew of people that tickle your brain and heart in just the right ways. Thinking to yourself “wow, I would like to be around people like that all the time”\n\nSee also: How to find the people that are trying to find you\nHow to find co-hosts §\nHaving co-hosts is a life hack to make sure the node survives beyond you. Can’t make it one day? Let them step in! Feeling demotivated? Here’s a built-in hype-man! The ideal co-host is someone you’re inspired by - someone you’d be excited to spend time with even if nobody else showed up. If you can’t find this person yet, it might be worth holding the first session yourself and seeing who it attracts. We’ve seen that the sweet spot is between 2-6 hosts. Only two people are really actively hosting at any given session, but it’s great to have people on rotation. This is because it’s hard to organize and enjoy what you’ve organized at the same time.\nThe organizers are the culture setters. Ideally they are:\n\nCompassionate - They see value in spending time around people different from themselves and thinks all people have interesting things to share\nPeople that make things! - To attract the type of people that are also doing cool things, real will recognize real.\nAgentic - They just get things done. However, they should be low ego enough to experiment\nFun - A little bit silly, a little bit goofy (underrated)\nDiverse! - Not just in demographic, but in interests. Teach us how to draw! Tell us about climbing a mountain! Walk us through your latest read! All that good stuff.\n\nHow to find the people that are trying to find you §\nTLDR: Go to events and organizations that preach creativity and action, as well as other types of social and outreach related events.\nSeeking people §\nIf you wanted to get involved with ____ scene at your university/city, what events/organization/people would you go to?\nGo to places that are trying to stimulate the same creativity you are looking for:\nEg.\n\nUniversity/City clubs where people preach making things (engineering clubs, painting clubs, poetry clubs, coding clubs… etc)\nSpeaker/ social events where people look for community! Great for finding people interested in meeting other like minded people around a specific theme/goal (guest speaker events, founder socials, tech hubs, other co-working opportunities)\nStudent showcases or other places where students can show off their work (poetry nights, art showcases, science fairs, hackathons)\nBlogs/Personal Websites/Social Media/ Youtube people you know you think are super cool and are actively working on any of their active publishing content.\n\nIf they are showing up to these events, chances are they’ll pull up to your group gatherings! BE BOLD. Creative, action oriented people tend to enjoy learning about other projects and seeing what is out in the world. Reach out to the “coding gods” or “Shakespearen poets” in your life, there is no project too big, or too small to be worked on at Socratica! They might show up… or maybe not, but making that initial contact will help you curate your list of cool people you can nudge later, and introduce the idea of your club into their minds.\nBringing them back §\nAfter that initial contact, the rest of the work goes into the session and branding itself. One core value we believe at Socratica is, co-working is never that deep. We like to keep our branding and messaging as fun and light hearted as possible – presenting it as a hangout among friends more than anything else. Ensuring this vibe is communicated upon first contact with anyone you want to join the session, and at the sessions themselves is ESSENTIAL!! Keep in mind that the types of people we bring in will continue to shape the quality of the sessions as well!\n\nLook for creative people!! the ones working on a movie, blogging their hearts away, hacking on interesting problems. Tap them on the shoulder and invite them to Socratica :)\n\nMake sure they have a good time so they’ll invite their friends to Socratica.\n\n\nSeeking - Looking for people with high density of action, who’s work you admire/respect through personal websites/social medias/blogs, “depth first search”\nAttracting\n\nBranding - Who we market to is who we become.\nUsing silly language.\n\n\nMaintaining identity - Being ok with having small groups of people at the beginning\n\nHow to structure a session §\nNow that you have your host team and a list of aspiring Socraties, it’s time to start planning the session!\nYour goal will be to achieve 2 main things: give people time to work on their projects, and showcase + celebrate progress of any sort in your community.\nTo start, there are typically building blocks to a Socratica session: introductions, pomodoro work sessions, and demos.\nIntroduction to Socratica sessions §\n\nObjective: Aim to provide time for project work and celebrate community progress\nDuration: Typically, sessions last 3-4 hours, segmented into different activities\nKey elements:\n\nIntroductions: Start with 15 mins of buffer time for informal interactions, food and small talk, followed by a group address explaining what Socratica is.\nPomodoro Work Sessions: Structured periods for focused work.\nDemos: Short presentations/updates showcasing participation progress.\n\n\n\nRoles and Responsibilities §\n\nHosts: Rotate through various sub-roles:\n\nMain Host - Introduces the session, leads demos, announces breaks\nDemo Curator - Responsible for ensuring a diverse lineup of demos, choosing a demo order, making sure people are prepared before they demo\nTech Lead - Set up projector, timer &amp; music. Help transition demos smoothly.\nArchivists - Taking notes, snapping photos, sharing publicly\nProviders - This includes buying food, bringing equipment/resources\nGreeters - This involves hosts talking to people, inspiring them, matchmaking them with others, and encouraging them to demo!\nCurating the vibes – see How to organize spaces that feel awesome and How to maintain the vibe\n\n\nParticipants - The people who show up to your sessions and define the feel of the community.\n\nSession Setup §\n\nHosts should set up food, projectors/display and any other equipment.\nSeparate spaces for silent work and group-focused activities with a clear physical distinction to minimize distractions.\nGet attendees to help you with setting up food, cleaning up, and other small tasks to give them a glimpse into the “behind the scenes”. It really makes people feel like a part of something.\n\nIntroductions and Icebreakers §\n\nMingling:\n\nEncourage people to mingle in groups with unfamiliar people! Accomplish this by yelling or cowbell announcements.\n\n\nIcebreaker Circles:\n\nRun smaller intro circles to identify potential hosts. It also helps boost confidence for people that dont think they’re qualified.\nPeople feel SO gassed up when you ask them to run these circles. The more involved people are, the more invested they become.\nThe introduction questions can range from silly to serious. The best ones make people think and give people conversation jumping-off points. Stray from things talking about what they’ve been up to recently, or more surface topics. Hits from our term include:\n\nWhat is one way you’ve changed your mind recently?\nWhat do you wish more people knew about you?\nWhat is your greatest delusion? What do you believe about the world that seems irrational to everyone else?\nDo you have any secret talents?\nWhat could you give a 15 minute impromptu presentation on?\nWhat’s a hobby you’ve been meaning to take up but haven’t yet?\nWhat have you spent over 100 hours doing?\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Sessions §\n\nWork Blocks (50 mins):\n\nWhen it’s time to start, announce it and usher people who still want to talk into the group work area.\nEmphasize that the work block is for deep and quiet work.\nHave a timer up in a way that is visible to everyone. Ideally try to have access to a projector, TV or a spare device that can have the timer presented throughout the session.\n\n\nBreak (10 mins):\n\nThe perfect time to follow up on projects you find interesting!\nStart looking out for potential demoers for the session and tapping them on their shoulders!\n\n\nWork Block 2 (50 mins):\n\nAfter breaks, people may continue socializing. Feel free to nudge them into group talking work areas to ensure they are not disturbing others who are starting to pick up work again.\nAnd continue to tap people on the shoulder for demoing!\n\n\n\nDemos §\n\nIdeally, keep each demo around 5 minutes with around 4-5 demos. Allow for questions after the demo!\nEncourage a wide range of demoer’s, across the domain of the project, the stage of the project and the type of speaker.\nAnd take photos! Document everything!\nRead more under How to hold great demos\n\nThe TLDR: We usually do (10-1PM) but this is flexible! We also run a (2-5PM) session too.\n\n  \n   Time\n   \n   Description\n   \n    Extra Tip\n   \n  \n  \n   10:00-10:15\n   \n   Eating time. Have fun, help set up food. Mingle and let people eat a bit before settling down. Also good for letting people trickle in.\t\n   \n   This is when to find people that might want to lead a circle for the coming section\n   \n  \n  \n   10:15-10:30\t\n   \n   Introductions. Split people off into groups of maximum 10. Do a round of introductions where people mention their name, what specifically they are working on, and answer an icebreaker question.\t\n   \n   If people are vague about what they want to do, ask the facilitator to drill in. We want the DEETS. Also frame the question in the way where you want to know their success metric for this session. Have some way to document the projects. This can be done by people filling in a form, or by someone taking notes. Also the best of these sessions are a bit silly.\n   \n  \n  \n   10:30-11:25\t\n   \n   Work block 1. We found it works best if this is silent because it’s the only way to get work done in the room of people you’d want to talk to.\t\n   \n   Have a timer up in a way that is visible to everyone\n   \n  \n  \n   11:25-11:35\t\n   \n   Break! This is a great time to follow up on projects you find interesting.\t\n   \n   Prompt people to talk to people that they haven’t! Make sure there are no wallflowers\n   \n  \n  \n   11:35-12:30\t\n   \n   Work block 2. This one can be a little more social, but still good to keep it more silent.\t\n   \n   A good time to start tapping people on the shoulder to demo.\n   \n  \n  \n   12:30-12:55\t\n   \n   Demos! Loosely five, five minute presentations. Set the expectation that it should be 4 minutes presenting and 1 minute for questions. Take photos!\t\n   \n   Plant people to make sure every presenter receives at least 1 question. More tips below.\n   \n  \n  \n   12:55-1:00\t\n   \n   Weekly wins and parting announcements. Go around the room and have people shout out things that they are proud of (or not) from the week. This is also when to let people know to be added to the Discord.\t\n   \n   It is fun to applaud them after.\n   \n  \n\nHow to hold great demos §\nIn a company, there are three actions that matter in setting culture: who you hire, fire, and promote. Within a community, the “promotion” becomes who you give the most visibility to. In this case, it’s who you choose to demo and host.\nTo find great demo-ers, backchannel with other hosts, tap on people who have been showing up consistently, encourage folks working on projects you find interesting, chances are, other people will find it interesting too (see: How to find the people that are trying to find you). Actively encourage people to demo at all points in their creation process because every project starts somewhere. Frame demos as an opportunity to share and celebrate progress rather than show off polished work (that is what How to organize a symposium is for).\nThe following are some learnings from a few years of facilitating demos:\n\n\nVisuals: Ideally, having accompanying visuals is fantastic! Visuals are more engaging and get people excited about the project. It also helps to get people excited…. To complete. This doesn’t have to be a screen-shared website. It can be a physical painting, hardware project, or even the demoer themselves doing something live (i.e. guitarist)\n\n\nStorytelling: Encourage demo-ers to tell a story! Especially if it’s the first time someone is demoing, encourage them to start by sharing why they are working on their project.\n\n\nKeep an eye on the time: Time boxing is essential as audiences can become disengaged if demos go on for too long. Display a visible timer for the presenter, complete with a noticeable ringtone to signal the end of their allocated time.\n\n\nEncourage people to ask questions: Allocate time for questions; they often reveal valuable insights that could be the highlight of the session! To make sure that there is a variety of people asking questions across demos, as a host, tap on some folks and encourage them to ask questions. To build a strong culture, you have to actively create it. \nSome ways we’ve done this that have been successful are:\n_ encouraging specific people who are eager to ask and haven’t gotten a chance yet to demoers. Encourage the demo-ers to act like hosts and call on those people.\n_ If there aren’t enough questions, ask one yourself.\n\n\nDiversity of demos: When choosing presenters try to be diverse on these axises:\n\nTopic (Code, art, writing)\nProject Stage (Ideating, in progress, complete)\nSpeaker (Shyer people, confident returner, etc)\n\nTo keep folks engaged, order demos in such a way that it feels more diverse. You can do this by spacing out similar demo topics and starting with more creative and unpolished/work in progress demo’s so people who are unsure about demo-ing feel confident to demo their work in progress projects.\n\n\nEncourage and empower: Some people take 3-4 nudges of encouragement to think that they are qualified to demo. It’s our job to make people think they can and be constructive when they do. Your job as a host is to empower people to gain confidence in demoing and feel comfortable demoing unfinished work in this space. A good way to frame this for attendees is to frame demo-ing as an act of service to the community instead of a place to prove themselves worthy.\n\nHosts can work together with hesitant participants to provide demoing formats that make them more comfortable and confident. You can innovate along the lines of:\n\nTime length – experiment with different lengths of demos. 3 minutes can feel intimidating, maybe start with a 30 second demo\nDemo location – standing in the front of the room can be scary, experiment with demo formats where demos can be shared from their seats or in a circle setting.\nAudience size – if the sessions are large, you could experiment with having smaller demo groups\n1:1 encouragement – ask them about their project 1:1 during break sessions, show authentic curiosity, tell them “that would make a great demo”\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging dynamics: The only time we’ve really ever really had tense conflict was during the question section of a demo. Be deliberate and step in if things are getting weird. If you think the vibes are off, the audience probably thinks so too. A gentle way to redirect a Q&amp;A is to mention that time is up (if the conversation has been going for a while) or ask to move on to the next question and suggest folks discuss further after demos.\n\n\nBody language: Remind people to close or lower their laptop screens, encourage folks to take off their headphones and to give the presenters their full attention. Encourage people to stand up and gather near the demoer when people are sitting down at their desks it’s easy for them to get distracted during peoples demos\n\n\nCommon failure modes are: As a host, you should look out for these and do not hesitate to intervene early.\n\nPresenter ignores timer and goes on for way too long\n\nOpen your phone and set a timer to go off at maximum volume. When the timer goes off, jump in with “Thank you for demoing” and start clapping.\n\n\nPresenter speaks very technically\n\nRemind them that their audience includes people who are non-technical. Post in an open forum afterwards so that they provide detail to those interested.\n\n\nPresenter speaks very early stage, doesn’t have clearly defined project yet\n\nAsk probing questions: “What did you specifically work on today?”\n\n\nToo many people want to demo and there is not enough time for everyone\n\nReassure people who don’t get a chance that they can demo next week.\nCreate spaces for anyone to share projects at any time, such as a discord channel for projects, or Instagram account highlighting projects.\nThis is also a good time to reward folks that attend consistently – effort gate!\n\n\n\nHow to Brand §\nYour brand identity is extremely important, and extends far beyond the surface of fonts and colours. It’s how you present yourself as an organization– the way that you write, your uniquely obscene usage of emojis, and the vibes you curate at events.\nOur pillars for brand identity:\n\nBe exploratory: keep things open to interpretation by your team.\nBe recognizable: as an influx of bland and unspeaking brand identities pour into clubs, choose assets and create designs that reflect your club, truly\n\nDon’t be template-y or overly corporate (unless that is your vibe)- make things that make people want to sign up!\n\n\nBe authentic ;) no matter what design style you lean into, make sure it is accurate to your organization and its principles (ie. silly, fun, ambitious, playful )\n\nEstablish your systems early, but acknowledge that they will evolve. As your org changes, your public facing image will likely change too. Despite having a design system with recommended type treatments and layouts, the Waterloo team treats our 10 page Figma file as a guide.\nWe embrace the styles of our individual designers whilst setting the bar approachably low. The best brand identities create emotional associations with your work– so strive to create reputable designs with re-usable and iconic elements. When people see a post, they should instantly recognize that it is us.\nWhat branding includes:\n\nBrand Personality\n\nYour Name\nLogos\nColour Pallette\nTypography\nVisual Elements like Illustrations\nPhotography/Videography Style\n\n\nVoice and Tone\n\nIe. Mission Statement, Tagline, and Brand Values\n\n\nOverall User Experience\n\nHow does your website reflect this?\nWhat stories, emails, Lumas, and posts create and expand your digital presence?\n\n\n\nTL;DR this is important stuff. Never forget to put fun and welcoming first. It doesn’t have to be ‘beautiful’ or ‘perfect’ for you to post it!"},"index":{"title":"Welcome to Socratica","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"maintenance":{"title":"Maintenance","links":["cultivating-people","getting-started"],"tags":[],"content":"How to handoff to new hosts §\nBeyond fostering spaces for amazing work, longevity should be one of the primary areas of focus for nodes. Being able to identify and nurture relationships with other awesome people who will carry the torch for the community is incredibly important, and making sure you’ve set out a plan for how the node will last beyond you is essential!\nTo some extent, this document originated from the work existing hosts did to make sure incoming hosts would be able to run and scale sessions without dealing with any loss of context. So much of the work that goes into Socratica is experimental, and a great handoff allows us to try more things while banking on a foundation of tried and tested principles.\nGeneral Notes/Thoughts §\n\nFirst, form an incoming team! The host role is a fair amount of commitment, and it’s always valuable to have more than two hosts at any given time, especially when accounting for weekend travel plans, midterms and academic commitments, and general availability.\nHandoff needs to happen early — the more time you give new hosts to get used to the additional responsibility, the better. Ideally, new hosts attend the last couple sessions of the previous term to get an idea of the basic responsibilities of running sessions (food ordering, location set up, etc.) without having to worry about remembering everything.\nFor a deep dive into the role of a host and setting yourself up for success within the role, look at the cultivating people section of the toolbox!\n\nChoosing hosts §\n\nCultivate the relationships early\nLook for people that already embody the values you want to carry forward\nPeople that don’t know that they want to be hosts\n\nSee also: How to find co-hosts\nHow to fundraise §\nFor many, the first mistake is to focus too much on having funding before running a session. Our point here is that you don’t need much more than space, cool people &amp; friends, and good vibes. Back when Socratica Toronto was first getting started, it was ten friends, too many cookies, and the food court. We could have skipped the cookies and it would have still been great. Anyways, an event doesn’t have to have all the bells and whistles to be a good one; it just needs to be memorable to the people who are there. Money can be an excellent way to add to your events, but it is in no way a prerequisite: often, having financial infrastructure, sponsors, a full process for raising funds, and everything associated with it can actually be a hindrance to running good events.\nTL;DR: don’t let yourself get overly serious in the beginning; raise money when it’s absolutely, unequivocally necessary to add to your events.\nAll that being said, if exploring funding options sounds like a good idea for your node, here are some ideas that have worked well for us in the past:\nVenture Firms §\n\nIncentive:\n\nLots of amazing things come out of universities and likely these sessions! They want to be the first to know. Them sponsoring = paying you to do advertising on behalf of their brand.\n\n\nWhere to find:\n\nAt Waterloo, we’re sponsored by Contrary—we built this relationship through organizer involvement in their VP + now defunct Fellowship program. Twitter is a great place to find other firms, both student-oriented and general, that could sponsor. Others include https://neo.com/, https://www.dormroomfund.com/, https://roughdraft.vc/, https://firstround.com/talent/  and https://www.rippleventures.com/\n\n\nWatch out for:\n\nPredatory firms taking advantage of uneducated students.\nDoing unpaid labour on behalf of for-profit companies – make sure it’s “your agenda” and they’re sponsoring it / partnering, if it’s their agenda they should be hiring someone and paying them.\nRequests for exclusive access to the community (e.g. no other sponsors allowed) - again, this is unpaid labour on behalf of a company.\nFirms that don’t align with your values – your partnership is your endorsement, people will trust your judgment of character more than they trust their own.\n\n\n\nAccelerators and Incubators §\n\nIncentive:\n\nWanting excellent bias-to-action people (and obviously the companies that sprout from them). Them sponsoring = paying you to do advertising on behalf of their brand AND trying to buy loyalty and gain trust for if/when attendees want to be part of the accelerator\n\n\nWhere to find:\n\nYour university’s entrepreneurship or engineering faculty are good places to start to your search—Waterloo receives support from Velocity and Eigenspace; university-focused accelerators are mandated to support students!\nPress—most new accelerators &amp; funds will have some kind of public process for recruiting founders. See TechCrunch/Forbes\n\n\nWatch out for:\n\nThey might not have a budget to sponsor stuff, likely more able to give you space / resources / connections. For these things, they might charge money because it’s part of their business model. See venture firm red flags\n\n\n\nLocal startups and companies §\n\nIncentive:\n\nWanting to give back and cultivate ecosystem\nBuilding some kind of hiring pipeline or local cultural values\n\n\nWhere to find:\n\nGoogle maps! Startups close to your university are usually there for a reason—seek help from those around you first!\nValues aligned founders and companies\nWord of mouth\nCompanies with history of supporting young / underrepresented people\n\n\nWatch out for:\n\nSpace that’s not close to where your target demographic lives / not accessible via transit\nValues alignment: the relationship your members may have with a company you work with is deeper than that of a VC or accelerator; ask yourself if you’d work for them as a potential employee &amp; if you truly feel represented by them.\n\n\n\nIndividual altruists §\n\nIncentive:\n\nBelieving in a better version of the world and wanting to be part of making it happen\n\n\nWhere to find:\n\nAlumni of stuff related to your attendees\nSimilar demographic of attendees or family members who are similar demographic of attendees\nBuilding stuff that feels values aligned\n\n\nWatch out for:\n\nThese relationships may be harder to “pass off” term over term as they are highly personal and variable to individuals’ financial situations\n\n\n\nGrants §\n\nIncentive:\n\nBelieving in a better version of the world and wanting to be part of making it happen\n\n\nWhere to find:\n\nTwitter, the internet (Curius!)\nRationality/special interest communities (or anywhere else independent research is conducted/emphasized)\nLocal universities\nCity, Government\nLocal banks\n\n\nWatch out for:\n\nMake sure the effort expended: money received ratio is worth it. Your time has value (especially as an organizer)!\nBe wary of super long shot stuff, really focus on ones where you feel you are the ideal candidate applying. Local stuff is great.\n\n\n"},"superboosting-ideas":{"title":"Superboosting Ideas","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Types of Ideas §\nA core pillar of building a community for people to see the best version of their ideas is to understand ideas, how they progress over time, and how you can support your people at each stage of their idea.\nBaby ideas §\nLike babies, these ideas are focused on learning and exploring the world around them. They revolve around consuming knowledge and building skills. These are low commitment and short-term.\nExamples: reading a book, practicing Duolingo, learning a new guitar song, making a to-do list app\nPeople working on baby ideas often don’t know what they don’t know (link: dunning kruger effect). As a host, connect participants with baby ideas with the resources they need: send them articles you come across in their domain and introduce them to other people in the community.\nA lot of people with baby ideas don’t even know what their idea is yet. (link to Raising Baby Ideas)\nTeenage ideas §\nThe slightly awkward, but really interesting stage of ideas. People at this stage start moving towards being a creator, putting their knowledge and skills to use to build something they are passionate about. These are mid-level commitment and mid-term.\nExamples: writing and producing a song, storyboarding a climate documentary, building a website that shows you how far you can go with transit.\nWorking on a teenage idea is scary. People working on teenage ideas are putting themselves “out there” for the first time, and often, the ideas won’t be very good. But the only way to get good is to get the teenage ideas out of the way and learn as you go.\nAs a host, it’s essential to de-risk sharing teenage ideas and help participants feel more confident at the early stages of their work. (link: How to Organize Spaces that feel awesome)\nAdult ideas: Seeing them all grown up makes us feel all of the emotions. Adult ideas are inherently more mature. They have some success (users, fans, viewers, followers) and are dedicated to growing even further. They are high-commitment, long-term projects.\nExamples: a VC-backed startup, Youtuber with 50k followers, AR/VR research projects\nWise Elder ideas: §\nThe retired ideas that are no longer actively running, but leave behind a legacy of mistakes, learnings, and celebrations. People with wise elder ideas reflect on their journey and share mentorship.\nExamples: ex-president of a social justice club, sunsetted greenhouse project in Sri Lanka\nCurrently, Socratica is best positioned to support baby and teenage ideas. We are still learning and exploring how we can support adult and wise elder ideas.\nHow to choose ideas to work on §\nWhat is an idea?\nIt sometimes helps to fall back to the roots of the word. Idea, as defined by Merriam-Webster is “a formulated thought or opinion.” It can often be the case that we overcomplicate things but at its core, an idea is just that … a thought or opinion that is formulated in some way, shape or form in the real world. As hosts, it is important to bring the barrier to entry of an idea down to its crumbs so that it is perceived as totally achievable by every human as opposed to this behemoth raindrop from the gods bestowed only upon the favoured.\nFinding an idea to work on is a partnership between hosts and participants to help them explore parts of themselves that they didn’t think were valuable enough or didn’t know existed. There are various ways to inspire thought that could turn to valuable underpinnings of a creation.\nBelow is a set of guiding questions for hosts to ask to help inspire ideas:\n\nNeglected hobbies\n\nIf you weren’t in school / co-op/job that takes up your being on the weekdays, what would you be doing right now?\nIf you could take a year off of school/work, how would you spend that year?\nWhat makes you feel creative?\n\n\nChildhood hobbies\n\nWhat did you spend time doing when you were 9 years old? 3? 6? 14?\nIf you gave Young [Insert Your Name Here] $50, what would they spend it on?\n\n\nExplorations\n\nWhat is something you are terrible at, but think would be really fun?\nIs there a field that you know absolutely nothing about?\n\n\nConjuring of realities\n\nIf you lived in a post-scarcity/abundance world, what is it that you at this point of time would want to spend your time on?\nImagine a utopia created entirely by you with the paint of a brush on a blank canvas. What does that world look like? How does this world not live up to the expectations?\n\n\n\nAnother subclass of thought/action experiments that could inspire are:\n\nWork on what you go to bed thinking about and then also wake up thinking about\nWork on what you think about in the shower\nWrite down every idea you have, or every thing that you think about in abundance and this could turn to an idea booklet\nWork on what you talk to your friends about a lot\n\nOne thing you’ll observe amongst all the above questions is that they are all what questions. These start the conversation but are often only surface-level. An entire set of _why _questions that can unravel the birth of the answer to the _what _questions can be helpful for further roots of inspiration.\nSome people will also work on “bridge” ideas - a low-risk project that helps to feel included in the space and give time to be inspired by other demos. Common “bridge” ideas:\n\nPersonal / portfolio website\nTaking an online course\n\nThere is yet another set of activities where people are spending time learning meta-skills. These are included but not limited to:\n\nLearning new programming languages\nWriting\nLearning new instruments\n\nThese can often also be excellent ideas to work on, especially if somebody’s curiosity is enchanted by a particular skill.\nCommon Failure modes\n\nUnfocused work\nChoosing work you think others expect you to work on\n\nOftentimes, this manifests as people working on projects based on their major of study.\nThe Socratica environment/crowd is not impenetrable from this critique. Acceptance, no matter from whom is the other side of the coin for community. We are social creatures and crave reward. This is fine insofar as the purpose of the collective serves you.\n\n\nTrying to defy the laws of growth and birth a fully-developed senior citizen idea\n\nOther seminal resources on idea-ing:\n\nhttps://tyler.cafe/foundational_skills\nhttp://www.paulgraham.com/getideas.html\n\nHow to raise baby ideas §\nSome thoughts from aadil:\n\nI try to get to know someone very broadly as quick as possible, then take mental notes of cawhat they mention a lot, or what makes their eyes light up when they talk about, or what they say with a positive tone\nI then take that thing that they talked about, that they often didn’t even realize they mentioned positively/a lot, and then I ask them questions about it with the goal of understanding, not persuading\nThen I ask something in the vein of “why aren’t you doing that now” or “what would you do if you had inf. time/money”, and see what they say\nMost often, i never actually tell them to do the thing, i just mention all the times they’ve mentioned it, and they usually realize “yeah shit, i actually do really care about this thing”\nAnd then I actually usually leave it at that. I’m not in the biz of forcing people to do stuff. But if I sense they’re someone who is on the cusp of diving into a passion/moved by my questions and actually thinks about their thoughts, I suggest them a really basic plan ie. try it for a week, come work on it at socratica, you do this part and ill help you with the other part thats hard if you do the first part.\nU can only really nurture people who are willing to grow, and people only truly do stuff if they wanna do it, not if u tell them - they’re just scared/confused/timid, so i try to do what i can to figure out then point out what’s holding them back, and make it seem smaller/less scary than they originally thought, and then what happens happens\nBONUS: often those negative feelings are from a lack of confidence/belief - offering a little help, a little money, a little ”im in this with you” tends to give that person a belief in themselves for the first time - anyone can give a “yeah thats cool, you should do it, sgtm” but being so invested that u offer ur own time/money, even if they dont take it, is a really positive signal to them\n\nHow to organize a symposium §\nThe symposium is vital to showing off our achievements to a broader range of people at the end of a term. It’s an event full of experimentation and trying things for the sake of getting a laugh out of it. It’s also an event where you have to try extra hard; if the symposium goes too smoothly, it means you haven’t tried hard enough. We see it is almost as giant funnel to inspire people to show what can be achieved within a term. The goal is to foster curiosity and interest within the community by highlighting the diversity and breadth of projects underway.\nMost of our documentation from past terms at Waterloo are included in The Symposium Files. This is going to be your best friend.\nComponents to Execute the Best Symposium\n\nHow to do logistics and venue:\n\nStart planning the Symposium at least 2 months in advance. It’s a lot more high effort than you think.\nEnsure a well-equipped venue that resonates with the vibe of the symposium.\nPeople will be disappointed if there are technical issues. Prioritize having reliable AV equipment to facilitate clear communication and presentation.\nPeople love good food. Maintain high standards of hospitality with quality food and refreshments.\nStart inviting special guests early!\n\n\nWho should demo?\n\nEncourage a variety of presentations ranging from booth to stage demos. (poetry, dune paintings, documentaries, startups, robot dog and everything in between)\nDon’t intimidate the attendees with fully completed projects! Feature projects in various stages of completion to showcase a broad spectrum of talents and ideas.\n\n\nHow to find demoers?\n\nProactively identify people with intriguing projects from socratica to demo at the symposium.\nMaintain a dynamic list of potential demonstrators and ensure it is continuously updated and curated. Always be on the lookout.\nRule of thumb; if you think a project is really cool, others might think so too. So ask them if they want to demo!\n\n\nHow to create sparkle?\n\nView the symposium as a canvas where creative expressions and innovative ideas are encouraged. We &lt;3 experimentation and trying random shit that might be funny.\nNever stagnate! If things go too smoothly it means you haven’t tried hard enough. Continuously seek ways to enhance the appeal and “sparkle” of the event to make it more engaging and memorable.\n\n\nHow to delegate work?\n\nFirstly, form a great team, identify each person’s strengths, and roles automatically delegate themselves. Fun people should be in charge of sparkle, creatives for branding, urgent people for logistics, etc.\nGive people ownership and make deadlines clear. Do not have several unnecessary meetings. Instead just have a sync every two weeks. Trust that people will get their tasks done; again this is going off the assumption that you have great responsible hosts :)\n\n\nHow to do “everything else that I did not cover above”?\n\nThe symposium has so many intricacies and could be written into a novel. Yet, a lot of it is dependent on deep thought and being extremely organized with your timelines. Refer back to The Symposium Files as a template to understand what is needed and draw inspiration from past symposiums.\nYou got this! Don’t be intimidated by the amount of work, it’s actually a lot of fun! And you will (hopefully) have some great hosts and helpers to make the path easier for you! \\\n\n\n"}}
